# Night Guard (for Diabetes) - what is it about?

Night Guard is offshot of famous NightScout project, and also some others (xDrip, Parakeet), which produce little different hardware for similar software.

Intent is to make this less DIY project as it is now. End user just needs to configure himself/herself on our system (for now this can be found under www.atech-software.com/nightguard), set configuration on hardware (we have also partner where you can order NightGuard/NightScout/xDrip/ modules) and start.

# Web site
Our website is currently www.atech-software.com/nightguard. Service is not free (at least it won't be free when we are out of beta phase), you pay 2 EUR for one diabetes device (not one connector) for one month.


# How to start
1. You need to register yourself on website
2. Build yourself connector (see next chapter), or order one (we have subcontractor who can make you connector, if you can't build it yourself, see Ordering connector).
3. Load correct software (see Software for connector)
4. Register your diabetes device (we currently only support Dexcom 4). 
5. Register connector you will use to download data. 
6. Install xDrip+ software (we might create our own version in future, but for now we use this one, see Software chapter)
7. And we are done.

# Connector - what is that?
Connector is actually device, that will read data from your diabetes device (e.g. Sensor) and send it to NightGuard webservice. We currently support two such connectors:
1. xDrip/xBridge/xBridge2: Wixel (Processor with Radio Receiver) and BlueTooth module which sends data via your Mobile device to NightGuard webservice.
2. Parakeet: Wixel (Processor with Radio Receiver) and SIM module which send data with help of SIM card to NightGuard webservice.
